Glad you asked 👌 — planning **routes (pages/endpoints)** early is super important in structuring your webapp. Since your app has **three user types (child, parent, teacher)**, each version should feel tailored.

Here’s a structured suggestion 👇

---

## 🧒 Child Version (Webapp / Companion)

Goal: Make it **fun, friendly, and motivational**.
Routes:

1. `/dashboard` – Personalized daily summary (“Hey! Here’s your progress today 👋”)
2. `/activities` – AI-suggested fun tasks (drawing, puzzles, sports goals)
3. `/mood-check` – Simple check-in (emoji/mood tracker, journaling)
4. `/skills` – Gamified skill-building path (badges, progress tracker)
5. `/goals` – Short-term goals (school tasks, personal milestones)
6. `/chat-bot` – AI companion chat (like Alexa, friendly assistant)
7. `/profile` – Child’s avatar, achievements, rewards

---

## 👨‍👩‍👧 Parent Version

Goal: Give **insights + actionable guidance**.
Routes:

1. `/dashboard` – Overview of child’s skills, mood, health, academics
2. `/reports` – Detailed weekly/monthly reports
3. `/progress` – Visual graphs (academic vs. creative vs. sports growth)
4. `/recommendations` – AI tips (e.g., enroll in drawing class, encourage morning walks)
5. `/notifications` – Alerts about unusual behavior, mood changes, missed goals
6. `/messages` – Communication with teachers & school updates
7. `/settings` – Family preferences, privacy settings

## 👩‍🏫 Teacher Version

Goal: **Classroom-level insights** and easier child management.
Routes:

1. `/dashboard` – Class overview (which students need attention)
2. `/student/:id` – Individual student profile (skills, interests, health insights)
3. `/reports` – AI-generated performance & well-being reports
4. `/interventions` – Suggestions on how to help specific students
5. `/assignments` – Ability to link school tasks/goals into system
6. `/messages` – Communicate with parents directly
7. `/school-insights` – Patterns (e.g., “30% of class shows high interest in sports”)

## ⚙️ Shared / Common Routes (All Users)

* `/login` – Authentication
* `/signup` – Registration (optional if schools onboard)
* `/help` – Support, FAQ
* `/privacy` – Data & policy center

---

✨ **Tip for MVP**:
Don’t build all routes at once. Start with:

* Child: `/dashboard`, `/mood-check`, `/chat-bot`
* Parent: `/dashboard`, `/reports`
* Teacher: `/dashboard`, `/student/:id`

That’s enough to **test your core loop**:
👉 Child interacts → AI analyzes → Parents & Teachers see insights.

Would you like me to **draft a visual sitemap diagram** (like a tree view of all routes) so you can see how the webapp flows together?
